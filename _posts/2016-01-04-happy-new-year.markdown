<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">So, another year has passed and for me it has been pretty light on the running front. I have no real races to analyse and have only completed a handful of 5k time trials, however I have done a lot of amazing things. Back in February I embarked, alone, on my first backpacking adventure to New Zealand and Australia and this trip completely changed the rest of my year. After spending a brief four weeks back in the UK, I returned to New Zealand where I found a job and made some great friends - I think its been a pretty big year for me. So, everyone likes to make a New Years resolution for the coming twelve months...what will mine be? Well, it may be a bit of a common one but I want to start running more again, I've realised I miss my slight obsession with racking up the miles and while I'm temporarily settled here, in a city with some brilliant trail running right on my doorstep, it seems a shame not to make the most of it. Just the other day in fact, nothing except a run in the pouring rain could make me happy, arriving home after seven kilometres, dripping wet and with a huge smile on my face, it was exactly what I needed. So I have decided that my New Year goal is to run at least three times a week, every other day if I can, to make it a habit again, part of my daily routine. I think that is why I used to find it so easy to average five to six miles a day, because that was just what I did at 6pm every night, not going for a run then felt strange, as though something was missing and I want to get back to that. Hopefully I will manage to keep to this goal, and hopefully for longer than just the first month of 2016...</p>
