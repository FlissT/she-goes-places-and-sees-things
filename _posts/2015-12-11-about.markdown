<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">For quite a few years now, running has been my passion. I try to do it as often as I can and find it therapeutic, meditative, invigorating and, usually, enjoyable. I have competed in road races ranging from 5km to a full marathon as well as distance track and also cross country events up to National level. I run in any weather, at any time of year despite the occasional odd look from family and friends when heading out in torrential rain or a snowstorm. For the last few years I have lived between Cambridge and Sheffield, both cities offering a variety of terrains and trails, from the flat East Anglian countryside to the city streets and the rugged Peak District surrounding Sheffield. I am currently based in Wellington, New Zealand and have continued my running here. On this site, I intend to tell a few running-related tales from my experiences as a long distance enthusiast.</p>
