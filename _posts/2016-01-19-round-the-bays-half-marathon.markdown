<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">So I have just entered my first half marathon for eighteen months, the Cigna Round the Bays. I haven't run that far in about a year and I have just five weeks to prepare. My old personal best, run in 2014, was in the region of 97 minutes and to try to even get close to this with only just over a month in which to train may sound incredibly optimistic...and it probably is. Earlier tonight, just before I filled out my entry form, I went for a 'practise run', ten miles at what I hope is a realistic race pace and it went pretty well. I managed it in an hour and twenty three minutes including traffic light stops, which is encouraging. Obviously I know that it's overly ambitious to aim at anywhere near my pb pace and this time I just want to see if I can still run that distance competitively. Having scouted out the first half of the course, it seems pleasantly flat although being Wellington, the waterfront is prone to some quite ferocious gusts of wind which may make things more challenging!</p>
