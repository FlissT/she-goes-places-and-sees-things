<p align="JUSTIFY">Queenstown is a crazy place. It is located on New Zealand's South Island and is famous for being the 'adrenaline capital' and ultimate party town. It is also probably the least 'Kiwi' town that I have been to in New Zealand and I've been to quite a few of them. In the time I spent there, I barely met anyone who was actually from New Zealand, almost everyone there seems to be tourists or just 'there for a season'. It is also an incredibly busy place. For a fairly small town, there are a lot of hostels and all of them seemed to be full pretty much all the time, it isn't somewhere that you can just show up and expect to find somewhere to sleep for the night. I spent several days whilst I was there wandering the streets all afternoon, having just been made to check out of a hostel that was full.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">To be honest, before I actually arrived in Queenstown myself, I was sceptical about the town and its reputation, I was expecting non-stop all-day and all-night partying, loud bars and bright lights. In reality, I was pleasantly surprised, which is why I ended up spending three weeks there instead of the couple of days allocated on the Stray bus itinerary.

<p align="JUSTIFY">Yes, at night there are a lot of bars which are very busy and loud with a lot of very drunk people in them, but there are also quieter places without all of that, where you can actually have a good time. During the day, the town is fairly calm, full of cafés and people relaxing by the beautiful Lake Wakatipu. That last point is also an excellent reason to visit Queenstown - its scenery is amazing. The combination of the brilliantly blue lake, the Remarkables mountain range looming in the background and the green pine forests is stunning, with the view only enhanced at sunset.

<p align="JUSTIFY">From the gondola station you can enjoy a panoramic view, Queenstown below looking like toy town protruding into the large expanse of blue water. Even just a walk along the lake-front is gorgeous. The first time I went for a run through the Queenstown gardens, I barely got anywhere as I had to keep stopping to take photos.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to be bored in Queenstown as aside from drinking, there are an abundance of things to do. There's the big one - bungee jumping, jet boating on the Shotover river, paragliding, parasailing, cycling, go-karts, hiking, frisbee golf... the list goes on. The focus is very much on outdoor, extreme activities, it is not a place for the faint-hearted! Then there is the famous Fergburger. For those that don't know, this burger joint has become an institution in Queenstown, renowned for its huge, delicious burgers. It is open virtually all day and night and always has a queue stretching well down the road. Trying a Fergburger is definitely a Queenstown bucket list item.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A few of the best things that I did in Queenstown include hiking to the summit of Ben Lomond, the 1748m mountain lurking just out of view of the town, which I did without realising quite how much of a 'proper' mountain it is, fuelled mainly by a hangover and a cup of coffee. It was a strenuous days hiking, first up the steep track to the gondola station and then on into the hills, past the saddle and up to the summit. Unfortunately when we arrived at the top, there was a generous covering of clouds over a lot of the landscape but the views we did get were incredible.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Another of my favourites was a cycle ride along the edges of Lake Wakatipu, through Frankton and into the Lower Shotover Valley. Hiring a bike was straightforward and the cycle paths well-marked which made it a lovely way to see some of the countryside surrounding the town. Frisbee golf also makes  for a fun afternoon, the course is in the Queenstown Gardens just by the lake and frisbees can be hired or borrowed from hostels.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">While Queenstown is a fantastic place to visit, it does have its downsides. Presumably as a result of its popularity and its fairly remote location on the South Island, it can be expensive. In the town itself, the supermarket is small and pricey however there is a slightly cheaper one if you don't mind walking a little way out of town. Cafés and bars are also quite expensive and usually add a surcharge on public holidays (although this is common throughout New Zealand). While I was there, we managed to find a very cheap bar, 1876, and as a result spent almost every evening there. In fact, we only realised how long we had been in Queenstown when we worked out that we had seen their weekly band play three times! Hostels as well will generally set you back quite a few dollars and are usually very busy during the peak seasons – don't necessarily assume you can just turn up and find a bed. Travelling on one of the backpacker buses means that you will guarantee yourself a bed for your first night and usually at a slightly discounted price. If you're keen to partake in adrenaline-raising activities such as bungy jumping then be prepared to fork out for the experience, good deals can sometimes be found online however.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">If visiting New Zealand, I would definitely say that you should not miss out on Queenstown. It was one of my favourite places that I visited whilst backpacking and I'm glad I had time to be able to spend three weeks there as just a couple of nights wouldn't have fully done it justice (although would of course be better than not visiting at all). It's a fun, lively town with plenty to do that is great in summer or winter (ski season!) and as long as you plan ahead a little, you will have a fantastic time!</p>
