<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">So, just a little update on my half marathon training as this time in two weeks I'll be running it! I have increased my mileage quite a lot from what I have been doing recently and I've been surprised at how well I seem to have responded to training again. I have also read some very interesting articles about how actually having a long rest period after heavy training can be a good thing as your muscles retain the ability to respond to training, so it doesn't take the same amount of time to regain fitness as it did to build it in the first place. In some of my recent training runs, I have managed a 1oK in 45 minutes and 11 miles in about an hour and a half, which are the sort of times I used to run in training sessions. I am encouraged that come race day, I should be able to get round in under two hours, especially if the weather is kind to me! i have however, realised the importance of being mentally strong while running and getting enough sleep. Earlier this week, after a poor night's sleep, I had one of the worst training runs I've ever had. It was a very hot evening, I was trying to run 10K and it just wasn't happening. I felt like I was running through treacle, I kept telling myself I couldn't do it, that I wasn't ready to race so soon, I was virtually in tears. By the time I got to the gym for my planned post-run session, I was actually in tears and having a full-on meltdown. The next day though, I tried another run of the same distance, this one was back to how I normally run, my normal pace, my normal confidence that I'll be OK. This really highlighted to me how important it is to get enough sleep, to be able to recover and think properly - a lesson well learnt!</p>
