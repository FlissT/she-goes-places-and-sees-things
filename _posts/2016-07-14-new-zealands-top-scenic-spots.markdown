<p align="JUSTIFY">New Zealand is well known for its stunning natural beauty and diverse landscapes, which are reasons why so many tourists and backpackers want to visit. From the many places that I've now visited, here are a few that I think are among the best.</p>
<h3 align="JUSTIFY">Aoraki/Mount Cook</h3>
<div style="float:left; padding-right:30px; padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px">

</div>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mount Cook (known as Aoraki in M<span style="font-family:'Sans Serif';">ƒÅ</span>ori) is the highest mountain in New Zealand, standing at 3,724 metres and it is impressive both from the ground and from 16,000 feet up! The walk along the Hooker Valley track from Mount Cook Village leads to one of the most gorgeous views I have ever seen, with the mountain perfectly reflected, in good weather at least, in the glacial lake in front of it. Standing by the water's edge gives a sense of the enormous scale of the mountains and glaciers surrounding you. From above, the landscape is equally striking. Skydiving over the Fox Glacier allows you to see the country's highest peak and glaciers from a more unusual angle. From so high up, you are treated to a panoramic view of Mount Cook and right out over the West coast, which is definitely worth jumping out of an aeroplane for!</p>

<h3 align="JUSTIFY">Tongariro Alpine Crossing</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Tongariro Alpine Crossing is a very popular 19.4 km day hike around Mt Tongariro, Mt Ruapehu and Mt Ngauruhoe, which tends to feature pretty highly on backpacking itineraries. The trail passes through volcanic and alpine terrain with highlights including the Emerald Lakes, Red Crater and views out over the central North Island. While it does require a decent level of fitness to cope with the mountainous terrain for 6-8 hours, the walk is pretty accessible and I've seen everyone from children to parents with baby backpacks to older folk taking it on. If you've got time, take a detour to the summit of Mt Tongariro, where if it isn't too cloudy, you will be treated to some brilliant views over the somewhat lunar landscape.</p>

<h3 align="JUSTIFY">Queenstown</h3>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Queenstown, known as the adventure capital of the country, is set in some incredibly picturesque surroundings. Lake Wakatipu, surrounded by the Remarkables mountains, often resembles a painting or photograph. The contrast of the rocky slopes rising from the deep blue water looks even more magical at sunset when the skies become streaked with pink and orange. The view from the top of the Gondola station, 450 metres above Queenstown, gives the feeling of looking over a toy-town, with the Botanic Gardens jutting out into the lake and paragliders often gracing the skies. From up there, you also get a sense of how enormous the lake is, nestled around the mountains. Another good vantage point is from the summit of Queenstown Hill where not only can you see Lake Wakatipu, but also the Shotover Valley behind you.</p>

<h3 align="JUSTIFY">Punakaiki Pancake Rocks</h3>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Punakaiki Pancake Rocks are an incredible geological feature found on the South Island's West Coast. The rocky columns, arches and blowholes formed from layers of limestone over thousands of years extend along the coastline and out into the ocean, the waves spraying upwards as they collide with the rocks. There is a short loop walkway along the cliff edge to allow a close-up view of this popular natural phenomenon.</p>

<h3 align="JUSTIFY">Milford Sound</h3>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">A boat trip through Milford Sound really is a New Zealand classic and features on many itineraries. While far from being the only sound or fjord, it is the most famous and definitely draws the crowds despite its remote location. The imposing Mitre Peak soars almost 1700m into the skies, surrounded by seemingly vertical cliff faces rising from the deep waters. If you're lucky, you may see dolphins and fur seals and the odd kayaker will put into perspective just how enormous the sound is. Boat cruises here are very popular though so don't be too surprised to find yourself in amongst a lot of camera-toting tourists.</p>

<h3 align="JUSTIFY">Inter-Island Ferry</h3>

<p align="JUSTIFY">While not exactly a destination, the ferry ride between the North and South Islands is without a doubt the most scenic ferry trip I've ever taken. The journey takes three hours to cross the Cook Strait, from the capital city Wellington in the North over to Picton in the South. Watching Wellington harbour fading into the distance is pretty enough but the real treat comes when the boat begins to wind through the Queen Charlotte Sounds. Around a hour of the crossing is spent in these waters and you'll want to make sure you're out on the deck to take in the views.</p>

<h3 align="JUSTIFY">Waimangu Volcanic Valley</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Waimangu, near Rotorua, shows off nature at its finest and wildest. Volcanic landscapes, geothermal hot springs, mineral formations and blue, green and pink lakes are among the best features here and it's well worth spending the day exploring the trails through the valley. <a href="http://www.shegoesplacesandseesthings.com/travel/rotorua/" target="_blank">Visit Rotorua</a> for more on the valley and to see what's on offer elsewhere in Rotorua.</p>
